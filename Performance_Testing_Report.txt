Dear, 

Iâ€™ve completed performance test on frequently used API for test App. 
Test executed for the below mentioned scenario in server 000.000.000.00. 

200 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 10 ; Total Concurrent API requested: 600 And Error Rate 0%.
500 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 25 ; Total Concurrent API requested: 1500 And Error Rate 0%.
1000 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 50 ; Total Concurrent API requested: 3000 And Error Rate 0%.
1500 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 75 ; Total Concurrent API requested: 4500 And Error Rate 0%.
1560 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 78 ; Total Concurrent API requested: 4680 And Error Rate 0.13%.
1575 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 77 ; Total Concurrent API requested: 4725 And Error Rate 1.71%


While executed 1560 concurrent request, found  4680 request got connection timeout and error rate is 0.13%. 

Summary: Server can handle almost concurrent 1550 API call with almost zero (0) error rate.
